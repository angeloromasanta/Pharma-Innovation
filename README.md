#What is this for?
I am doing my PhD, integrating data science and the social sciences to study the technique in the pharmaceutical industry called fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). Studying various aspects of it, I will upload various scripts I have done for my work.

## Bibliometrics
I am studying the technical publications in FBDD and also management/business articles on the pharmaceutical industry. I wrote a code to parse data collected from the Web of Science into a dataframe, equivalent to a csv/excel file for manual checking. This in turn can later be converted back to Web of Science format to be analyzed with other bibliometric software.

## Job Openings in Pharma
I wrote a script to download job openings in Euraxess
